<!--
    basically what we did was this :-
    1.  We created 3 different sections for 3 pricing panels, all with same class.
    2.  In each section, first we added a local png image, of class "pricing-img"
    3.  We created a Header defining the name of the plan, class = "pricing-header"
    4.  We created a list, specifying the benefits of that plan.
        4.1.    We gave the list tag with class = "pricing-features"
        4.2.    We gave the items with class = "pricing-features-items"
    5.  We created a span after these, that tells the price and gave it 
        class = "pricing-price"
    6.  Finally we added a link that says "Free trail" with class = "pricing-button"
    ***We gave each tag a seperate class, so that we can modify them in CSS
        as per our conveniences...
